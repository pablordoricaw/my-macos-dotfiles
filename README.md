# My macOS Dotfiles

This repository contains my macOS dotfiles managed by [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

I apply these dotfiles to a new Mac device using my [my-macos-setup](https://github.com/pablordoricaw/my-mac-setup) repository.

## Managing dotfiles

Refer to the [chezmoi User Guide](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/daily-operations/) for instructions on the specific commands to manage the dotfiles.

## ToDo
- [ ] Better ZSH dotfile management.
